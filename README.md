##Tweeter
An iOS project that explores the Twitter API and hamburger menus.

So far, this project is a semi-disaster. Most of the components are there but... well...

Hours Spent: `WAY too many considering the final result`

###Project Requirements

####Hamburger menu
- [sorta] Dragging anywhere in the view should reveal the menu.
- [ ] The menu should include links to your profile, the home timeline, and the mentions view.

####Profile page
- [ ] Contains the user header view
- [ ] Contains a section with the users basic stats: # tweets, # following, # followers
- [ ] Optional: Implement the paging view for the user description.
- [ ] Optional: As the paging view moves, increase the opacity of the background screen. See the actual Twitter app for this effect
- [ ] Optional: Pulling down the profile page should blur and resize the header image.
####Home Timeline
- [ ] Tapping on a user image should bring up that user's profile page
####Optional: Account switching
- [ ] Long press on tab bar to bring up Account view with animation
- [ ] Tap account to switch to
